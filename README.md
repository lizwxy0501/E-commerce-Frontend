# Angular Ecommerce

Successfully completed a project involving the development of a full-stack e-commerce application. 
The project comprised a **Spring Boot** back-end utilizing **REST APIs** and a **MySQL database**, 
along with an **Angular** front-end. 


The primary functionality of the application was centered around a shopping cart feature, 
enabling users to view a list of products, search for products, add or remove items from their cart (**CRUD** operations), 
and proceed with the checkout process.
